The project cooperation is done in a scrum-inspired way.<br>
The goal is to have a non-complete but runnable game since the end of the first iteration and then enhance it with features in every upcoming iteration.<br>
<br>
Here are the topics for the first iteration.

= Iteration 1 =

  # at least 4 markers with simple 3D objects
  # one enemy going straight from Point A to B
  # display any information (text or image) as a HUD
  # noticing when enemy is in range of towers
  # definition and handling of the map-marker
  # all the above points fit together in a project and checked in via SVN

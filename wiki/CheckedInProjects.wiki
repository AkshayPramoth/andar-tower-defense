*HOWTO:*<br>
I have a somehow strange behaviour on my Samsung Galaxy 9000i S:<br>
Application starts, but no 3D-models are shown.<br>
*Solution:*<br>
If the application is installed on the phone, I have to:<br>
  # go to applications->ManyModelsTest: Force close, reset cache and data
  # open Samsung Task Manager: Ram-Manager and clear memory on level 1 & 2
After these steps, restarting the application works and shows the models.

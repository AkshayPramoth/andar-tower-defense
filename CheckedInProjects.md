<b>HOWTO:</b><br>
I have a somehow strange behaviour on my Samsung Galaxy 9000i S:<br>
Application starts, but no 3D-models are shown.<br>
<b>Solution:</b><br>
If the application is installed on the phone, I have to:<br>
<ol><li>go to applications->ManyModelsTest: Force close, reset cache and data<br>
</li><li>open Samsung Task Manager: Ram-Manager and clear memory on level 1 & 2<br>
After these steps, restarting the application works and shows the models.

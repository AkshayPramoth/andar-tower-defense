The project cooperation is done in a scrum-inspired way.<br>
The goal is to have a non-complete but runnable game since the end of the first iteration and then enhance it with features in every upcoming iteration.<br>
<br>
Here are the topics for the first iteration.<br>
<br>
<h1>Iteration 1</h1>

<ol><li>at least 4 markers with simple 3D objects<br>
</li><li>one enemy going straight from Point A to B<br>
</li><li>display any information (text or image) as a HUD<br>
</li><li>noticing when enemy is in range of towers<br>
</li><li>definition and handling of the map-marker<br>
</li><li>all the above points fit together in a project and checked in via SVN</li></ol>

<h1>Iteration 2</h1>
